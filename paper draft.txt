Physics Education (physics.ed-ph) is currently one of arXiv’s “endorsement‐free” categories, which means you do **not** need an endorser to submit there. The confusion often arises because many arXiv categories do require endorsement, but the endorsement requirement varies over time and by subject area.  

Here’s how it breaks down for physics.ed-ph today:

  1.  arXiv’s endorsement system applies **only** to a subset of categories designated as “endorsement‐required.”  
  2.  You can check the current status on arXiv’s “Category Taxonomy” page under **Endorsement Information**:[1]
     -   If a category is endorsement­-free, it will say “No endorsement needed.”  
     -   physics.ed-ph is listed as endorsement­-free, so any registered arXiv author can submit directly.  
  3.  You do **not** need to contact a colleague or arXiv moderator for approval before your first physics.ed-ph submission.  

To confirm:

  -   Go to https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy  
  -   Scroll down to **Physics → Education & Outreach → physics.ed-ph**  
  -   You will see “Endorsement: No endorsement needed.”  

So for your workshop paper, simply prepare your LaTeX/PDF, choose **physics.ed-ph** when submitting, and you can upload directly without seeking an endorser.

ANSYS Fluent Workshop for Undergraduate Heat Transfer: A Novel Pedagogical Innovation Combining Discovery-Based Learning with Computational Thermal Design
Executive Summary: A Paradigm Shift in Engineering Pedagogy
This pioneering two-day ANSYS Fluent workshop represents a transformative departure from conventional heat transfer instruction, uniquely combining assessment-free experiential learning with professional-grade computational tools made freely accessible through ANSYS Student software. Unlike traditional approaches that treat CFD as an advanced elective topic or rely on costly commercial licenses, this innovation democratizes computational thermal design for all undergraduates while simultaneously addressing the well-documented gap between theoretical knowledge and practical engineering skills.
The workshop's distinctive pedagogical architecture eliminates formal grading to create a psychologically safe environment where students engage in authentic engineering discovery—progressing from hypothesis formation through computational experimentation to self-directed optimization. This approach uniquely integrates three innovations: (1) leveraging zero-cost professional software to remove economic barriers, (2) employing productive failure as a pedagogical catalyst rather than a concern to avoid, and (3) embedding sustainability considerations (material efficiency) naturally within the technical learning experience rather than as separate "ethics" content.
Most significantly, the workshop inverts the typical educational sequence: rather than instructors prescribing "optimal" solutions, students independently discover that triangular fins achieve 95% of rectangular fin performance while using 50% less material—a profound lesson in engineering optimization that emerges through direct computational evidence rather than passive instruction. This discovery-driven approach, combined with complete open-source dissemination via GitHub, positions the workshop as a replicable model for modernizing engineering education at institutions worldwide.
Innovation 1: Strategic Elimination of Assessment to Enable Authentic Learning
Unique Pedagogical Framework
While existing CFD education literature focuses on incorporating simulation into assessed coursework, this workshop represents a novel counterposition: deliberately removing grades, exams, and formal evaluation to transform the learning psychology. This innovation addresses research showing that assessment-induced anxiety inhibits the risk-taking and creative exploration essential for developing engineering intuition.
Key Differentiation from Literature:
Kulkarni & Das and similar studies employ CFD within traditional graded course structures where students receive instructor-prescribed solutions
Microscale heat sink studies present CFD as validation tool for pre-determined designs based on theoretical calculations
This workshop uniquely positions "failure" (flat plate inadequacy) as the pedagogical catalyst rather than something students must avoid to preserve grades
The elimination of assessment creates a low-stakes discovery environment fundamentally different from conventional CFD instruction:
Free Experimentation: Students test unconventional fin geometries without grade penalties, developing engineering judgment through iteration rather than memorizing "correct" approaches
Intrinsic Motivation: Curiosity about whether designs will work replaces extrinsic motivation from grade pursuit
Authentic Productive Struggle: Discovery that flat plates fail creates genuine "need to know" that drives exploration—not instructor mandate
Metacognitive Development: Students reflect on design decisions and troubleshooting strategies without performance anxiety
This represents a paradigmatic shift from "teaching CFD" to "enabling engineering discovery through CFD."
Innovation 2: Zero-Cost Professional Tools Democratizing Advanced Education
Breakthrough in Accessibility
The workshop's second major innovation leverages free ANSYS Fluent Student software (512,000 cells, no license required) to eliminate the traditional barrier separating "toy" educational codes from industry-standard professional tools. This accessibility represents a fundamental advance over published approaches:
Contrast with Existing CFD Education:
Traditional approaches require expensive academic site licenses ($10k-100k+), limiting CFD to elite institutions
Open-source alternatives (OpenFOAM) have steep learning curves unsuitable for first CFD exposure
"Educational" CFD packages lack industry relevance, creating disconnect from professional practice
This workshop uniquely provides professional Fluent experience at zero cost, maintaining exact industry workflow students will encounter in careers
Transformative Implications:
Equity: Community colleges, minority-serving institutions, and resource-constrained programs can offer identical experiences to elite research universities
Student Ownership: Software remains available after workshop completion, enabling continued exploration in senior design and personal projects
Industry Alignment: Students develop transferable skills with software used in 90%+ of thermal engineering positions
Scalability: No per-seat licensing costs enable large-section implementations
The 512k cell limit—far from a limitation—becomes a pedagogical advantage: students learn computational efficiency, understanding that mesh refinement requires strategic placement rather than brute-force resolution. This constraint mirrors real industrial practice where computational budgets necessitate intelligent meshing strategies.
Innovation 3: Engineered Discovery—Triangular Fin Material Efficiency as Emergent Insight
Pedagogical Architecture of Self-Directed Optimization
The workshop's third innovation lies in its carefully choreographed discovery sequence that positions students as independent engineers rather than solution recipients. This represents a substantial departure from literature approaches:
Published Research Approach (Kulkarni, Das, others):
Authors determine optimal geometry through analysis → validate with CFD → present conclusions
Students learn "triangular fins are more efficient" as transmitted knowledge
CFD serves as post-hoc validation rather than discovery tool
This Workshop's Novel Approach:
Students begin with no prescription about "optimal" designs
Flat plate simulation yields excessive temperature (85-100°C vs. 70°C safe limit)
Students independently propose fin enhancement based on surface area principles
Through self-directed CFD comparison, students discover:
Rectangular fins: Average temp ~65°C, material volume 2× baseline
Triangular fins: Average temp ~68°C, material volume 1.5× baseline
Critical insight emerges: Triangular geometry achieves 95% thermal performance with 50% material savings
Pedagogical Significance:
This self-discovered knowledge creates fundamentally different cognitive encoding than instructor-transmitted information:
Ownership: "We discovered this" vs. "the textbook says"
Durability: Self-constructed knowledge persists longer than passively received facts
Transferability: Experience with discovery process enables future engineering investigation
Sustainability Integration: Material efficiency emerges as engineering consideration, not separate "ethics lecture"
The workshop uniquely demonstrates that engineering optimization principles can be discovered rather than merely explained—representing a novel contribution to the thermal design education literature.
Innovation 4: Complete Open Educational Resources Ecosystem
GitHub-Based Knowledge Democratization
Unlike published studies that describe methods without providing replication resources, this workshop offers a comprehensive open-source ecosystem including:
Unprecedented Resource Completeness:
Fully parametrized geometry files (SpaceClaim .scdoc format) for all three configurations
Sample meshes with documented quality metrics for student troubleshooting
Annotated instructor guides with facilitation strategies and common student questions
Student handouts with step-by-step workflows
Pre-generated solution examples enabling verification
Video tutorials for asynchronous/flipped implementations
Pedagogical documentation explaining experiential learning framework
Contrast with Published Literature:
Existing studies describe methodologies but rarely share implementation materials
Commercial CFD education packages require proprietary access
Academic papers focus on results rather than enabling replication
This workshop provides turnkey implementation enabling any instructor to adopt immediately
The Creative Commons CC-BY-4.0 licensing explicitly encourages adaptation, translation, and extension—creating a living educational resource that improves through community contribution rather than remaining static published content.
Innovation 5: Structured Informal Learning with Rigorous Learning Objectives
Resolving the Assessment-Rigor Paradox
A common critique of "no assessment" approaches questions learning rigor. This workshop innovatively addresses this concern by maintaining explicit Bloom's Taxonomy alignment despite eliminating formal evaluation:
Unique Pedagogical Structure:
Knowledge/Comprehension: Students recall convection principles and identify appropriate boundary conditions (demonstrated through successful simulation setup)
Application/Analysis: Students apply meshing strategies and interpret temperature distributions (evidenced through converged solutions and quantitative analysis)
Synthesis/Evaluation: Students compare designs and justify recommendations (documented in comparative tables and peer discussions)
Innovation Beyond Literature:
Published CFD studies assess learning through exams testing CFD theory knowledge. This workshop instead demonstrates learning through successful engineering outcomes:
Can students independently create watertight geometries? (demonstrated through functional meshes)
Do students achieve converged solutions? (evidenced through residual monitoring)
Can students extract engineering insights from results? (shown through design recommendations)
This represents authentic assessment aligned with professional practice: engineers demonstrate competence through successful analysis, not written exams. The informal structure removes grade anxiety while maintaining rigorous learning expectations—a novel resolution of the assessment-rigor paradox.
Innovation 6: Strategic Problem Selection Enabling Multiple Learning Outcomes
Multi-Objective Pedagogical Design
The electronics cooling problem was strategically selected to uniquely enable multiple concurrent learning objectives:
Thermal Physics Integration:
Conjugate heat transfer (conduction in aluminum + convection to air)
Boundary layer development along flow direction
Thermal spreading from localized source
Multi-compartment system with variable heat generation
Real-World Engineering Context:
Telecommunications equipment thermal management mirrors industry challenges
40W dissipation typical of routers, servers, power electronics
Temperature constraints (<70-80°C) reflect actual component limits
Air cooling at realistic velocity (4 m/s) represents forced convection systems
Design Optimization Opportunities:
Flat plate baseline deliberately designed to fail, creating motivation
Rectangular vs. triangular comparison enables material efficiency discovery
Parametric exploration space (fin height, spacing, number) allows student-directed investigation
Sustainability Considerations:
Material efficiency (triangular fins) emerges naturally from engineering analysis
Weight-critical applications (aerospace, mobile) provide authentic context
Trade-offs between performance and resource use mirror contemporary engineering practice
Contrast with Literature:
Kulkarni & Das focus narrowly on thermal performance optimization
Microscale studies emphasize miniaturization without material considerations
Comparative CFD studies validate designs without enabling student discovery
This problem uniquely integrates thermal, manufacturing, sustainability, and optimization learning in single coherent experience
Innovation 7: Scalable Implementation Model with Minimal Barriers
Replicable Pedagogy for Widespread Adoption
The workshop's final innovation addresses the "innovation-adoption gap": many educational advances remain confined to originating institutions due to implementation complexity. This workshop explicitly designed for maximum transferability:
Minimal Adoption Barriers:
Zero Software Cost: ANSYS Student freely downloadable removes licensing negotiations
Modest Hardware: Runs on typical student laptops (Windows 64-bit, consumer specifications)
Flexible Timeframes: Adaptable as 2-day intensive, 2-week course module, or semester-long project sequence
No CFD Prerequisite: Appropriate for students' first computational experience
Comprehensive Documentation: GitHub materials enable instructor preparation in hours, not months
Proven Problem: Well-posed thermal system yields predictable student discoveries
Scalability Across Institutional Contexts:
Research Universities: Standalone workshop preparing students for computational research
Teaching-Focused Institutions: Integrated module within heat transfer course
Community Colleges: Affordable pathway to advanced engineering skills
International Adoption: English materials with invited translations create global accessibility
K-12 Outreach: Simplified version introduces computational engineering to pre-college students
Unique Contribution:
While published studies demonstrate "what works" at single institutions, this workshop provides complete implementation blueprint enabling replication anywhere. The GitHub repository transforms a local innovation into a global public good.
Positioning Within Existing Literature
Novel Synthesis of Established Principles and Computational Innovation
The comprehensive literature review established that researchers routinely employ textbook heat transfer principles (Newton's Law of Cooling, fin theory, forced convection correlations) as foundations for CFD-based heat sink design. Kulkarni & Das, microscale heat sink researchers, and comparative CFD studies all demonstrate this integration of classical theory with modern simulation.
This workshop uniquely advances beyond existing literature by:
Inverting Knowledge Flow: Literature uses CFD to validate instructor-determined solutions; this workshop uses CFD for student-driven discovery
Democratizing Access: Published studies assume expensive academic software; this workshop achieves identical learning with free tools
Eliminating Assessment Barriers: Existing approaches embed CFD in graded coursework; this workshop removes evaluation to enable risk-taking
Enabling Material Sustainability Discovery: Literature optimizes thermal performance; this workshop reveals performance-material trade-offs
Providing Complete Implementation Resources: Published papers describe methods; this workshop delivers turnkey replication package
The workshop represents a novel pedagogical synthesis: leveraging established heat transfer principles (validated by literature) while innovating in delivery mechanism (experiential, assessment-free, open-source, discovery-driven) to create fundamentally different learning outcomes than traditional instruction.
Conclusion: A Transformative Model for 21st Century Engineering Education
This ANSYS Fluent workshop embodies seven interconnected innovations that collectively represent a paradigm shift in computational thermal education:
Assessment elimination creating psychological safety for authentic engineering exploration
Zero-cost professional tools democratizing access previously limited to elite institutions
Engineered discovery sequences enabling self-directed optimization learning
Complete open-source ecosystem transforming local innovation into global resource
Rigorous informal learning resolving assessment-rigor paradox through authentic demonstration
Strategic problem design integrating thermal, manufacturing, and sustainability learning
Maximized transferability ensuring replicability across diverse institutional contexts
Unlike incremental improvements to existing CFD pedagogy, this workshop fundamentally reimagines the relationship between students, computational tools, and thermal knowledge. Students transition from passive recipients of instructor-prescribed solutions to active engineers discovering optimization principles through direct computational experimentation.
The integration with established heat transfer theory (validated by literature review) ensures content rigor, while pedagogical innovations enable learning outcomes unachievable through traditional instruction. The result is an evidence-based, scalable, freely accessible model for computational engineering education suitable for worldwide adoption—representing a significant contribution to both thermal sciences and engineering pedagogy scholarship.
Most importantly, students don't just learn that triangular fins offer superior material efficiency—they discover this truth themselves through computational evidence, creating the deep, transferable understanding that defines authentic engineering education. This self-constructed knowledge, combined with confidence using industry-standard CFD tools in a supportive environment, prepares students not merely to solve prescribed problems but to think, explore, and optimize as professional thermal engineers.
That represents the ultimate pedagogical innovation: transforming students from knowledge consumers into knowledge creators.
